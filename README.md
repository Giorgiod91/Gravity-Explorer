# Gravity Explorer

**Gravity Explorer** is an interactive web application that lets users experience the effects of gravity on a ball across different planets. By simulating gravity, you can "throw" the ball or "jump" to see how it moves differently depending on the planetâ€™s gravitational pull. This is an engaging, hands-on way to explore how gravity varies on different planets.
